# Waste-Management-System
The device enables the authority to assert the garbage level indicating that they are 80% or 90% full. Via the mobile communications network, the signal are sent to a software application used by the waste management company.
The system is developed using PIC Microcontroller because embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance.
By using this device, the collection of waste in the city becomes more easier. It helps in reducing air pollution, traffic flow and man power.

## Requirements
1. OrCAD Capture
2. MPLab IDE
3. Terminal
4. Serial Bootloader AN1310

## Procedure
1. OrCAD Capture is used to design schematic diagram of the system
2. Program PIC Microcontroller using MPLab IDE
3. Terminal is used to establish connection between the hardware and software using Bluetooth Module
4. Bootloader is used to verify the obtained results
